This is a project designed to simplify the way java developers interact with the Foursquare V2 API.

With this project a developer should be easily able to deserialize a response from the api into pojo's with a few lines of code.  

Many Java platforms have their own API for making http requests.  In my case it was the difference between Android and Google App Engine.  I choose to remove this component and let you maintain the finite control over the requests while this package deals with mapping the response data into Checkins, Users and everything else.

Any questions, comments or requests to help: support@checkinassistant.com
This project is being maintained specificically for "Check in Assistant":http://checkinasst.com, and "FourGui.de":http://fourgui.de
